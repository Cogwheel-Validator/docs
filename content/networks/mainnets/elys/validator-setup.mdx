# Validator setup for Elys Network

This guide will assume you have already set up your node. 
If you haven't, please refer to the [node setup guide](/networks/s/).

## Create keys and validator

<Callout type="info" text={`Make sure to change values for moniker, identity, details website to your own values.`} />

```bash
#Create the wallet ( replace #keyname with whatever name you want)
elysd keys add #keyname
```


For Cosmos SDK 0.50 and above we need to first gather the private key details and then create a validator.json file containing the validator information.

Use the following command to get the private key details.
```bash
# Get the private key details
elysd comet show-validator
```

And then create the validator.json file. Make sure to set the pubkey to the value from the command above.
```json
{
        "pubkey": {"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"insertFromTheCommandAbove"},
        "amount": "1000000uelys",
        "moniker": "validatorName",
        "identity": "optional identity signature (ex. UPort or Keybase)",
        "website": "validator's (optional) website",
        "security": "validator's (optional) security contact email",
        "details": "validator's (optional) details",
        "commission-rate": "0.1",
        "commission-max-rate": "0.2",
        "commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
        "min-self-delegation": "1"
}
```

And then create the validator. Make sure to set the path to the validator.json file and the keyname.
```bash
# Set a path to the validator.json file in this instance we assume it is in the current directory
elysd tx staking create-validator ./validator.json \
--chain-id= elys-1 \
--from= #keyname \
--gas= "auto" \
--gas-prices= "0.01uelys" \
--gas-adjustment=1.5
```
