# Restake

Restake app is available [here](https://restake.cogwheel.zone).

Restake is a unique service that allows you to grant us the necessary
permissions to compound your staked assets. Why should you compound? When
your assets are compounded, your original staking amount increases,
leading to even greater earnings.

## Tutorial: Basic Actions

This section guides you on delegating, activating restake, and revoking grants.
Creating new grants is an advanced feature, recommended for experienced users.

### Staking

1. Select the blockchain to delegate your assets.
2. Connect your wallet (Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation).
3. Choose the validator to stake with.
4. Press "View," switch to "Stake, tab" and select "Delegate."
5. Insert the staking amount and confirm the transaction.

Example that we used here is for Dyson Protocol but it should be the same for every other chain.
